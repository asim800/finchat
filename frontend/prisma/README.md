# Prisma Schema Organization

This is the single source of truth for the database schema, organized by domain for clarity.

## Schema Sections

### üåê Shared/Market Data Models
**Location**: Top of schema  
**Purpose**: Models used by multiple services (frontend, FastAPI, microservices)  
**Models**:
- `HistoricalPrice` - Market data and price history

### üë• Frontend/User Data Models  
**Location**: Bottom of schema  
**Purpose**: Models specific to the web application

#### User Management
- `User` - Application users with profile data
- `ApiKey` - User's encrypted API keys for external services
- `Account` - Connected bank/financial accounts

#### Portfolio Management
- `Portfolio` - User investment portfolios
- `Asset` - Individual holdings (stocks, bonds, options, etc.)

#### Chat System
- `ChatSession` - AI chat sessions (guest and authenticated)
- `Message` - Individual chat messages with metadata

#### Learning/Content Management
- `FinancialTerm` - Financial glossary terms with categories and keywords

## Usage Notes

### For Frontend Development
```typescript
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db'

// Access any model
const terms = await prisma.financialTerm.findMany()
const prices = await prisma.historicalPrice.findMany()
```

### For FastAPI/External Services
The same database can be accessed by other services for shared models like `HistoricalPrice`.

### Schema Updates
1. Edit `frontend/prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run `npx prisma db push` or create migration
3. Run `npx prisma generate` to update client
4. Restart development server

## Migration Strategy
- **Shared models**: Coordinate changes across all services
- **Frontend models**: Can be updated independently
- Always test schema changes in development first
